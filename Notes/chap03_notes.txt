Notes for Chapter 3: Roundoff and Number Representation
========================================================

* Another example of truncation error:

octave:> sind(90.+360*1e12)
ans =  1.00000
octave:> sind(90.+360*1e13)
ans =  0.99998
octave:> sind(90.+360*1e14)
ans =  0.99950

or in Python
>>> numpy.sin(numpy.deg2rad(90.+360.*1e12))
0.9999999989100414
>>> numpy.sin(numpy.deg2rad(90.+360.*1e7))
1.0


* NAN is not equal to anything, even itself.
When a variable with a NaN value is compared to itself, my_var == my_var, the result is false.


* Homework problem:
Unix time is the number of seconds that have elapsed since 1 January 1970.
When Unix time is represented by a signed 32-bit integer, in what year will it overflow?
