Additional Homework Problem
===========================

Wien's constant: 
Planck's distribution is given by
\[
E(\lambda,T) = {2hc^2 \over \lambda^5} {1\over \exp(hc/\lambda k T) - 1}
\]
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength, $T$ temperature, and $h$, $c$, and $k$ are
fundamental physical constants.
a) Derive an equation for where $E$ assumes its maximum with respect to $\lambda$. 
b) Set $x = hc/(\lambda k T)$ and numerically solve for $x$
Wien's constant $b$ is given by $\lambda_{\rm max} = b/T$.
